<h1>256tm End User License Agreement</h1><p>When you purchase fonts, you actually purchase a license to use them on a certain number of computer devices (CPUs). </p>
<p>This is a end user licence agreement (EULA), between 256tm, represented by Thomas Huot-Marchand, and the end user (licensee) please read carefully.</p>
<p>§ 1.	Definition<br>
A font software (herein called «font» or «typeface») is a computer file containing a  coordinated set of scalable outline glyphs and spacing information («metrics» and «kerning»).</p>
<p>§ 2.	Intellectual property<br>
The font software and the related documents offered in the 256tm.com and myfonts.com websites are the intellectual property of Thomas Huot-Marchand / 256tm. </p>
<p>§ 3.	Licence Grant <br>
Upon full payment of the licence fee, 256tm grants the Licensee a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the font software and to save it on a maximum of five (5) workstations (CPU’s) at one single geographical location. In the event that additions to the above-mentioned restriction become necessary, the Licensee must purchase a multi-user license (MUL).  <br>
The Licensee may install the font software files on one single server and use them on one single local area network (LAN) only when the access to the font software files is limited to those workstations and printers belonging to the unit for which the licence was granted. The font software may not be installed on a server that can be accessed through the Internet or another external network by workstations that do not belong to the unit for which the licence was granted. <br>
Additional copies of the font software are authorised only for the purposes of backing-up data.<br>
Transferring the license to a third party is strictly prohibited in any circumstances under this EULA. Granting sublicenses is also strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>§ 4.	Usage restrictions<br>
The following is prohibited:<br>
- modifying the font software, <br>
- to decompile, transform, blend, adapt the font software and its content (including glyphs, metrics info, kerning info, OpenType features info)<br>
- create derivative works of the font software<br>
- modifying in any form or manner the Font(s), Font names and trademarks used in the Font Software. </p>
<p>§ 5.	 Electronic publishing<br>
Embedding of the font software into electronic documents (i. e. PDF or Flash files) or internet pages is permitted only in a secured read-only mode. You must ensure that recipients of these documents or pages cannot extract the font software. Using Adobe Illustrator or any similar applications to convert the glyphs into editable vector outlines (which are easily accessible to document recipients), is not an acceptable means of producing an electronic document for distribution.</p>
<p>§ 6.	Usage of Glyphs <br>
A special license is required when the font software or one single glyph of the font software is used to create a logotype or a product to be sold, or if the usage of the font adds value to a commercial product (i. e. if a single glyph is printed on a T-shirt).</p>
<p>§ 7.	Any violation by you of this agreement shall constitute a termination of this license. 256tm / Thomas Huot-Marchand  reserves the right to immediately terminate the EULA while reserving the explicit right to assert any further claims, such as damage compensation.<br>
In the event that the EULA is terminated, the Licensee is obligated to delete the Font Software from all media and to provide written assurance that said deletion has occurred. </p>
<p>§ 8.	Warranty and pricing<br>
Font software may not be returned or exchanged unless defective. Defective software shall be replaced by the same software if accompanied with purchase receipt and if 256tm / Thomas Huot-Marchand is notified within 30 days of purchase.<br>
256tm / Thomas Huot-Marchand cannot be held responsible for any damages caused or borne by the end user and/or third parties resulting from a misuse of the Font software and/or packages described above.<br>
The price includes all applicable taxes.</p>
<p>§ 9.	Final provisions<br>
The rights and obligations of the parties arising from this EULA are based on french law, even in the event that the exertion or breach of contractual rights takes place in a foreign country. Competent court: Besançon, Département of Doubs (25), France.</p>
